THE ANARCHIC KINGDOM

Thank you for installing The Anarchic Kingdom! This is a light strategy
game for one to eight players. It requires MS-DOS and a PC with at least
an 8088 processor and CGA graphics. It will also run under DOSBox.

RUNNING ON ORIGINAL HARDWARE

Assuming that you installed the game into its default location of
C:\ANARCHIC, you can run the game with the following sequence of
commands at the C> prompt:

C> cd \anarchic
C> anarchic

RUNNING ON DOSBOX

Some DOSBox installations have an easy way to run DOS executables by
right clicking on the icon for ANARCHIC.EXE and selecting "Run with
DOSBox" or similar. If your system doesn't have this facility, you can
type the following sequence of commands within DOSBox:

Z:\> mount c /home/user/msdos
Z:\> c:
C:\> cd anarchic
C:\ANARCHIC> anarchic

This example assumes you have installed The Anarchic Kingdom within a
directory called /home/user/msdos; if you have installed the game
elsewhere then substitute that directory name instead.
